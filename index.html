	<h1>Hi! This Is <samp>Hasan Tahmid</samp> </h1>
	<p><b>Bangladesh</b> is a new name for an old land whose history is little known to the wider world. A country chiefly famous in the West for media images of poverty, underdevelopment, and natural disasters, Bangladesh did not exist as an independent state until 1971. Willem van Schendel's history reveals the country's vibrant, colourful past and its diverse culture as it navigates <i>the extraordinary twists and turns that have created modern Bangladesh</i>.</p>

  <p>  <strong>The story begins with the early geological history of the delta which has decisively shaped Bangladesh society</strong>. The narrative then moves chronologically through the era of colonial rule, the partition of Bengal, <mark>the war with Pakistan and the birth of Bangladesh as an independent</mark>. <em> In so doing, it reveals the forces that have made Bangladesh what it is today. This is an eloquent introduction to a fascinating country and its resilient and inventive people</em>.</p>
